## hi 😁
My name is Rafael... (⊙_⊙;)

I'm most interested in all aspects of the design and implementation of applications, but I also have interests in data science (data engineering and machine learning), cybersecurity (hardening systems and security testing), and database design. 

## my skills 🤓
- JavaScript, Typescript, Java, R, and Python
- Angular, React, and EJS
- MLOPs (XAI tools, model monitoring, and AutoML tools)
- creating and using REST APIs
- an understanding of authentication/authorization
